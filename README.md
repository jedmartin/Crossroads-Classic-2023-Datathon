# Crossroads-Classic-2023-Datathon
A 12 hour datathon hosted by Butler University with the goal of taking a dataset and transforming it to take the view of what a salesperson could use and create a sales story for them, as well as forecast future sales. I was the team leader of the group that took home second place in the competition, winning $750. We used Tableau to create a user friendly dashboard that a salesperson could pick up and use without having any questions. We used predictive modeling techniques and trained our model to forecast the price of a truck with around 87% accuracy, the best in the competition. We used a linear regression model, and were able to find the most important factors in determining the price of a truck. After creating our model in R, we integrated it within Tableau to create an all-in-one intuitive dashboard.
